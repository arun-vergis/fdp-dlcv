If the learning rate is too high, new values will overwrite the knowledge from the old ones, and the network would perform unpredictably.

    "Multi-level networks can achieve higher accuracy than single-layer perceptron, however, they are not perfect for computer vision tasks. In images, there are some structural patterns that can help us classify an object regardless of it's position in the image, but perceptrons do not allow us to extract those patterns and look for them selectively. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) and Vision Transformers(ViTs) are more effective for computer vision tasks."
